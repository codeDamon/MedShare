# MedShare

## The problem MedShare solves

We often end up having leftover medicines that we no longer needs. These meds
will surely go into trash, creating waste, polluting and damaging our lovely earth.
Our app presents a solution to this. Anyone can donate their leftover meds, these
meds can be use by others (needy). 

Reducing medicinal waste, saving our earth,
and at the same time earning discounts on next medicine purchase.
Win Win for all.
